# border-radius-previewer

## Introduction

This project is a web interface that allows you to manipulate the border-radius property of an element and visualize changes in its shape in real time. If you wish, you can click on the "Copy" button and generate the CSS code of the element you just created.

The idea of ​​creating this interface was taken from [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). If you want to practice, there are excellent ideas there, I recommend it.

## Running

To access the web interface, just clone this repository and open the "index.html" file in your favorite browser.

## Final considerations

Feel free to use this code any way you like. Any suggestions I would love to hear. Cya! ;-)
